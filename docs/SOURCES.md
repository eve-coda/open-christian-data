# Sources and Acknowledgments

We stand on the shoulders of all those who come before.

Open Christian Data is possible because libraries, archives, publishers,
digitization projects, software communities, and individual editors made
public-domain Christian texts available in usable forms. This page records the
principal sources represented in the planned corrected `v0.2.0` release and the credit they have
requested or deserve. Reasonable efforts have been made to verify that the texts are public domain
or separately available under CC0, subject to the unresolved questions recorded below; however, no
guarantee is made, and errors or omissions may remain.

Specific source and edition information also travels with the dataset. The
acknowledgments here do not replace record-level provenance.

## Requested acknowledgments

### Hymnary.org

The collection of 34,904 public-domain hymn texts was provided by
[Hymnary.org](https://hymnary.org/) at Calvin University for inclusion in Open
Christian Data.

If you build something with the hymn collection, please:

1. link to [Hymnary.org](https://hymnary.org/) in your application or
   publication; and
2. tell Hymnary about your project through its
   [contact page](https://hymnary.org/contact).

The source-specific credit and data notes are preserved in the
[Hymnary README](../data/hymns/hymnary-pd/README.md).

### Christian Classics Ethereal Library

Many books, sermons, commentaries, devotionals, prayers, doctrinal documents,
and reference entries were **sourced via
[CCEL.org](https://www.ccel.org/)**.

CCEL confirmed that Open Christian Data may parse its ThML files to recover
underlying public-domain text. CCEL asks to be credited for making those files
available. Its formatting and other site material are not being presented as
public domain merely because the underlying historic works are public domain.
See the [CCEL permission and attribution note](sources/ccel-permission.md).

### Modern evangelical statements

- The [EFCA Statement of Faith (2019)](https://www.efca.org/sof) is
  reproduced from the official English page. EFCA states that the statement is
  in the public domain, says there is no copyright, and asks users to cite the
  complete text and identify any edits. This dataset preserves the official
  wording without editorial alteration.
- The [NAE Statement of Faith](https://www.nae.org/statement-of-faith/) is
  reproduced from the current official seven-paragraph web form captured in
  2026. The NAE first adopted a Statement of Faith in 1943; this dataset does
  not claim that the current wording is textually identical to the 1943 form.
  NAE states that it intentionally did not copyright the statement so that it
  may be used widely. Required attribution: **“As adopted by the National
  Association of Evangelicals.”**
- The [Lausanne Seoul Statement](https://lausanne.org/statement/the-seoul-statement)
  remains all rights reserved. Open Christian Data does not reproduce its full
  text. The dataset contains only a short, original research summary of its
  teaching on baptism and the Lord's Supper, with the official page retained as
  provenance.

## Rights layers

Three different things can have different rights:

1. the underlying work or translation;
2. a modern edition, transcription, digitization, or database; and
3. Open Christian Data's schema, processing, and release packaging.

An old work being public domain does not automatically make every modern
transcription or structured database CC0. Open Christian Data therefore keeps
source and edition provenance with the data and assesses source rights
separately.

The intended release posture is:

- **published dataset:** CC0 1.0 Universal;
- **underlying texts:** public domain or separately CC0; and
- **repository code, schemas, and tooling:** CC BY-NC 4.0.

## Rights follow-up from the v0.2.0 audit

The source audit found issues that require correction or additional evidence.
Attribution alone does not resolve them.

### Resolved — records removed

**Five ESV-derived doctrinal records have been removed.** The audit found five
records — `christ-hymn-of-colossians` (Col 1:15-19), `christ-hymn-of-philippians`
(Phil 2:6-10), `christian-shema` (1 Cor 8:6), `confession-of-peter` (Matt 16:16),
and `shema-yisrael` (Deut 6:4-5) — whose text was supplied by the upstream
Creeds.json project from the ESV (`esv.literalword.com`), a copyrighted modern
translation, and which were nevertheless labeled `cc0-1.0`. Each is a bare
Scripture passage rather than a composed creed, so the wording is wholly the
modern translation's and no public-domain text sits underneath to recover. They
were removed from `data/doctrinal-documents/` and from the parser's document
list; every passage remains available in the CC0 Berean Standard Bible under
`bible_text`. Restoring them as doctrinal documents requires re-sourcing the
wording from a public-domain or CC0 translation.

### Open

1. **JWBickel structured-data rights are unresolved.** The represented historic
   dictionaries are public domain, but the modern structured JSONL needs a
   recorded license or an independently built replacement.
2. **The Wikisource transcription basis needs confirmation.** The Lake
   translation is public domain, but the four exported prayers should be
   checked against an independent public-domain edition to ensure no
   contributor-created material was copied under share-alike terms.
3. **HistoricalChristianFaith carries a translation warning.** Its database
   notice says a small number of quotations may derive from copyrighted modern
   translations. Source-level review and the correction/removal route should
   remain open.

Until these are resolved, public wording should not claim that every released
record is unambiguously public domain merely because the original author died
before a particular year. Where a rights question cannot be resolved, the
affected records are removed or replaced rather than relabeled, as the five
ESV-derived records above were.
